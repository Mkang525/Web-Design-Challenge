## WeatherPy <br>
<br>
A series of scatter plots and linear regressions were created to showcase the relationships between a cities' distance from the equator and various weather conditions.   
Scatter plot images were saved as PNG files to be used in the dashboard.

Using OpenWeatherMap API, I was able to randomly retrieve latitude and longitude info from 500+ cities.
Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.
